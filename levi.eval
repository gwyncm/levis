Levi has been exposed to a number of advanced development technologies such as IP networking, HTML, Javascript, 
CSS, Bootstrap, Vuejs, json, git, nodejs, web components, vscode, linux, ssh, virtual machines, vpn, and web servers. 
Levi has done extremely well in understanding the environment we work in and has been able to contribute on several 
occasions to current projects. I am very pleased with Levi's progress in these advanced areas. We will be working on 
software application development, installation, and testing.
